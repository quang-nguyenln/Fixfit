# Fixfit

Fixfit is a digital closet mobile application that categorizes and stores user apparel. It was created as a side project using React Native & Firebase by [Chanbin Park](https://github.com/Chanbinski) and [Quang Nguyen](https://github.com/quang-nguyenln).

Other functionalities that we are still developing include fashion recommendations based on user preference using machine learning and a social feature where users can share their outfits with their friends and followers.
